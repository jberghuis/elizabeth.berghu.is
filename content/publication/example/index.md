abstract: The relationship between pain, disability, health-related quality of
  life and costs over time is explored. Disability resulted in higher societal
  costs compared to pain. Predictors of high societal costs are identified.
  Further the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sciatica treatments is
  investigated. The construct validity of the GPE is explored as well as the
  impact on results of correcting for statistical challenges in trial based
  economic evaluations.
